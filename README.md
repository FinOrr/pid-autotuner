## Introduction

Explore various PID tuning methods using C++ programming language. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of different PID tuning techniques and their implementations in realistic simulation environments.

### Objective:
- To introduce the fundamentals of PID control and the importance of tuning PID parameters.
- To explore and implement various PID tuning methods, including Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ziegler-Nichols method, Cohen-Coon method, Skogestad's Lambda tuning, Adaptive Control, Extended Kalman Filter, and Recursive Least Squares.
- Work through the process of setting up a simulation of a realistic control system in C++, designing a PID controller, and applying different tuning methods to optimise its performance.
- Gain insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and applicability of each tuning method through analysis and comparative evaluation.
- Develop the knowledge and skills to effectively tune PID controllers for different control objectives and system dynamics using advanced optimisation techniques.

### Structure:
- Each tuning method is located in a separate investigation method folder.
- The tuning method will then be introduced and analysed, discussing its principles, suitability, and parameters.
- The method will be implemented in C++ and integrated with the PID controller.
- Finally, the performance of the tuned PID controller will be evaluated through testing and analysis.

### Audience:
- This tutorial series is suitable for beginners and intermediate-level programmers interested in control systems, PID tuning, and optimisation techniques.
- Readers should have basic knowledge of C++ programming and familiarity with control systems concepts.

### Outcome:
- By the end of this tutorial series, readers will have a solid understanding of various PID tuning methods and their implementations in C++.
- They will be equipped with the skills to apply different optimisation techniques to tune PID controllers for a wide range of control systems and objectives.
- Readers will gain insights into the advantages, limitations, and practical considerations of each tuning method, enabling them to make informed decisions in real-world control applications.
